# BULK ACTIONS FOR PROXMOX VE

## ABSTRACT

`pve-bulk` is a utility script for the [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com) hypervisor, which is designed to perform some CT/VM bulk actions.

## DESCRIPTION

This script will execute the given action on each container and each virtual machine specified int the command-line.

You can specify the CT list by providing the `--ct-list` command-line option or by setting the `PVE_CT_LIST` environment variable.

You can specify the VM list by providing the `--vm-list` command-line option or by setting the `PVE_VM_LIST` environment variable.

By default, CT/VM lists default to `none`, meaning that no CTs/VMs are selected. You can specify `all`, `running` or `stopped` to pass the list of all, running or stopped CTs/VMs.

You can specify `--all`, `--running` or `--stopped` as a shortcut to set the corresponding value for both `--ct-list` and `--vm-list` options.

## HOWTO

### Install

If you have `make` on your system:

```bash
make install
```

If you don't have `make` on your system:

```bash
./utils/install.sh
```

### Uninstall

```bash
make uninstall
```

If you don't have `make` on your system:

./utils/uninstall.sh
```

### Build Debian package

If you have `make` on your system you can build a debian package:

```bash
make buildpackage
```

Then you can install the resulting debian package on your target PVE node:

```bash
apt install ./pve-bulk_X.X.X-X_amd64.deb
```
